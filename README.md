A macOS Quick Look extension for syntax-highlighted previews of configuration files and scripts.

Select a file in Finder, press Space, and get a formatted preview with proper syntax highlighting to make your MacAdmin life easier — no need to open a text editor to glance at a config file.

## Supported File Types

| Format | Extensions |
|---|---|
| JSON | `.json` |
| YAML | `.yaml`, `.yml` |
| TOML | `.toml` |
| XML | `.xml` |
| Mobileconfig / Plist | `.mobileconfig`, `.plist` |
| Shell | `.sh`, `.bash`, `.zsh`, `.ksh`, `.dash` |
| PowerShell | `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1` |

Mobileconfig and plist files get a special HIG-inspired rendering with profile metadata, payload details, and formatted key-value pairs.

YAML files with embedded SQL in `query:` values (common in osquery/Fleet configurations) automatically highlight the SQL syntax.

## Requirements

macOS 26.0 or later.

## Installation

You can build from source with Xcode:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Pique.xcodeproj -scheme Pique -config Release
```

Or use the pkg installer available in [Releases](../../releases).

## Enabling the Extension

On macOS 26, Quick Look extensions must be explicitly allowed. When you first launch Pique, you will see a notification:

Go to **System Settings > Login Items & Extensions > Quick Look Extensions** and enable **Pique**.
